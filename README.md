This is a collaboration to complete the project of the **File Management and Processing** Course at FCAI CU.

## Some rules To remember while we keep going in the assignment
- Always `git pull` before and after push to make you up to date 
- Separate commits where each commit has a certain change  
- Do **NOT** push all work in just one commit (unless the edit is small)  
- Write a meaningful message in the commit message
